 <p class="font2">BENGALURU: Accenture’s recent disclosure of their recruitment targets for FY25 has set a positive tone for Indian technology companies who’re set to report their Sept quarter earnings next month.

    “We are hiring primarily in India, as we are hiring more in technology. This also addresses our pyramid structure. We hire all over the world and in technology, which is a big driver for growth as we see for FY25. We will be hiring more in India,” Accenture CEO Julie Sweet told analysts in a recent earnings call. Accenture has over 3 lakh employees in India out of the 7.7 lakh globally. The company made a net addition of 41,484 people in the 2024 financial year.</p>
